                        <p>I am an undergraduate student that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursing Information Science and Computer Science, with a minor in Data Science.</p>
                        <p>My hobbies include hiking, leetcode solving, and playing video games. I am from the very rural Southeastern North Carolina, so spending time outside and eating are a must around me.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in data science and full stack development. I look forward to amping this site up over the next few weeks. In the meantime, feel free to connect with me and look at my GitHub projects.</p>
